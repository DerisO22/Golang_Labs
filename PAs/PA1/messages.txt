You will be rich
You will get an “A” on a test
A day of fun is around the corner
An item lost will soon be found
A phone call will bring good news
An upcoming school assignment will prove harder than you expected
You will be successful when you grow up

Not all those who wander are lost
All endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time
